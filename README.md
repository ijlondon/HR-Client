# HR-Client
Frontend code for the HR-System

How to start the client:
* cd to client folder
* create a .env file in the base directory with the following contents:
```
REACT_APP_API_HOST=http://localhost:8080/
REACT_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=[Ask Alex]
```
* run `npm install`
* run `npm start`

Should probably have other content in this section too

A big thank you to:
* me, myself, and I....no, other people really, just us.. #SQUAAAD
